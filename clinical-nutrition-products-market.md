<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clinical Nutrition Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parenteral Nutrition</li><li>Enteral Nutrition</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The clinical nutrition products market is primarily divided into two main types: parenteral nutrition and enteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition involves the intravenous administration of nutrients, bypassing the digestive system, and is essential for patients unable to consume food orally or via feeding tubes. Enteral nutrition, on the other hand, provides nutrients directly to the gastrointestinal tract through feeding tubes, catering to individuals who need nutritional support but have a functioning digestive system. Both approaches are crucial for patient recovery and management.</p></p>
