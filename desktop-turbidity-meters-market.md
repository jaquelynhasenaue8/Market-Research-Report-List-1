<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Turbidity Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scattered Light Turbidimeter</li><li>Transmitted Light Turbidimeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Desktop turbidity meters are classified into two main types: scattered light turbidimeters and transmitted light turbidimeters. Scattered light turbidimeters measure turbidity by detecting light scattered by particles suspended in a liquid, making them ideal for assessing low to medium turbidity levels. In contrast, transmitted light turbidimeters assess turbidity by measuring the amount of light that passes directly through a sample, suitable for higher turbidity levels. Both types offer critical insights for water quality monitoring across various applications, including environmental testing and industrial processes.</p></p>
