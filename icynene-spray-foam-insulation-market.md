<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Icynene Spray Foam Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cell Foam</li><li>Closed Cell Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Icynene spray foam insulation is a popular choice for energy-efficient building insulation, available in two main types: open cell and closed cell foam. Open cell foam is lightweight, flexible, and has a lower density, making it ideal for soundproofing and interior applications. Closed cell foam, on the other hand, is denser, more rigid, and provides superior thermal insulation, moisture resistance, and structural strength, making it suitable for exterior and high-performance applications. Both types expand to fill gaps, creating airtight seals and improving energy efficiency.</p></p>
