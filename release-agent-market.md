<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Mold Releases</li><li>External Mold Releases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The release agent market comprises two primary types: internal mold releases and external mold releases. Internal mold releases are integrated into the resin or polymer formulation, aiding in the separation of the product from the mold during the curing process. External mold releases, on the other hand, are applied directly onto the mold surface before forming, creating a barrier that facilitates easy part removal. Both types enhance efficiency, improve surface finish, and reduce wear on molds in various manufacturing applications.</p></p>
